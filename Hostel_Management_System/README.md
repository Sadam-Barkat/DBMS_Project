# Hostel Management System - DBMS Project

This repository contains the **Hostel Management System** project developed as part of the **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** course. The project includes a **PowerPoint presentation** (PPT) showcasing the **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and the **Normalization** process used in the system.

## Project Overview

The Hostel Management System is a database-driven system designed to manage hostel operations efficiently. It aims to streamline the process of room allocation, maintenance, student registration, and hostel fee management.

### Key Features

- **Room Allocation**: Assign students to available rooms and manage room availability.
- **Student Registration**: Store student details and manage hostel admissions.
- **Fee Management**: Track and manage hostel fees, payments, and due balances.
- **Maintenance Management**: Keep track of any maintenance issues within the hostel.
  
The project also covers the process of database design, including normalization and ERD creation.

## Project Structure


## ERD and Normalization

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: The PPT includes a detailed ERD representing the system's entities, their attributes, and relationships. 
- **Normalization**: The normalization process used to optimize the database design is also included in the PPT. It details the steps taken to bring the database to 3NF (Third Normal Form) to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
